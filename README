   		=== DAVIX ===

        Davix is a lightweight toolkit for remote file / object interactions
              with HTTP based protocols.

        Davix offers a multi-layer API for the end user :

            - High level POSIX file API, for convenience
            - High level Object API, REST like
            - Low Level API, compose your own HTTP query like with curl.


       Davix supports Http, Webdav ( and S3 )
       Davix integrate a Webdav / XML parser.

   * Davix is yet an other libcurl ?

	No, 

	- libcurl is defined as a "client side URL transfer".
		 it provides "protocol level" API, you compose your queries

	- Davix offers a "file level" API and aims 
		to provide a complete API for remote file / object operations
		

   * What does Davix support ?

        - " 4. cmake ../"
        - " 5. make "

    - Generate doc :
        - * run cmake
        - make doc

    - Compile and run unit tests :
        - cmake -DUNIT_TESTS=TRUE ../
        - make
        - make test

    - Compile & execute func tests :
         * warning : functionals test needs davserver and a valid credential
        - " 4. cmake  -DFUNCTIONAL_TESTS=TRUE ../ "
        - " 5. . ../test/setup_test_env.sh
        - " 5.  make; make test"

    - make RPMS :
        - ./packaging/bin/packager_rpm.sh ./packaging/rpm/specs/ ./
